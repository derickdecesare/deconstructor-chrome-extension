# Deconstructor Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that helps you understand words by breaking them down into their etymological components. This extension is based on the [Word Deconstructor](https://github.com/hyusap/deconstructor) project.

## Features

- Highlight any single word on a webpage, right-click, and select "Deconstruct" to analyze it
- Use the keyboard shortcut (Option+D) to analyze the currently selected word
- View a visual breakdown of the word's etymology and meaning
- Interactive graph showing word parts, origins, and combinations
- Customizable settings to enable/disable keyboard shortcuts and hover icons
- Requires an OpenAI API key (stored locally on your device)
